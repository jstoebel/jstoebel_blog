<p>Our most awesome group met on Friday in class to brainstorm ideas for how we can contribute to CodeWorkout.  Matt has been in touch with Steve Edwards the project&#8217;s lead. He suggested three possible areas for exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content creation: creating new workouts</li>
<li>Contributing to the user interface</li>
<li>Helping to develop a Q&amp;A section</li>
</ol>
<p>Poking around the site a bit we saw some ideas for possible contribution.</p>
<ol>
<li>As Steve suggested, the dashboard for students is fairly sparse. It doesn&#8217;t provide much information and isn&#8217;t super exciting visually. We could think about souping up the student dashboard to include more information that invites students to explore and interact with the various features of the app.  Ditto for a faculty dashboard. This project would give us opportunities to contribute on the back end (in Ruby) as well as sprucing things up on the front end using Javscript, jQuery and SCSS.</li>
<li>A Q&amp;A forum is also a terrific idea. In my experience as a relatively new developer I have had some anxiety about asking questions of strangers on Stackoverflow for fear of being criticized for asking a &#8220;dumb question&#8221;. This is where the pros goafter all. I&#8217;ve often had a question that is technically answered on SO, but the response is so over my head that it is effectively not useful to me. There could be some benefit in being able to pose your questions to other relative newbies. Who better to ask a question than someone who recently found the answer themselves. One useful feature of a Q&amp;A forum is for people to up-vote and down-vote an answer so that the most effective solutions can rise to the top. A good forum would also want to have relevant tags or channels so users can classify their tag into the right category, helping other user&#8217;s find the content they want quickly. Building a Q&amp;A forum from scratch might be too large of an undertaking, so we might investigate either a preexisting library to generate a Q&amp;A forum in our app, or investigate integrating with an already existing Q&amp;A forum.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general our team expressed some interest in starting small and working our way up to larger contributions. For example we might first focus on getting our environment set up, and then get our feet wet by contributing towards smaller, easier issues. As we are learning we would develop a design plan, propose it to the community and then once we have a bit more experience with the app, begin on our larger project with more confidence.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/jacobstoebel.wordpress.com/318/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/jacobstoebel.wordpress.com/318/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=jacobstoebel.wordpress.com&#038;blog=104465458&#038;post=318&#038;subd=jacobstoebel&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
