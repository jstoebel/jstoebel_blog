We have four weeks left in CSC 486. In that time we need to consider what we would like to accomplish. This should include both our contribution to CodeWorkout as well as what we would like to produce to represent our work for the semester (portfolio, presentation, final blog posts etc.).  For me, this is the time line I envision.

 - __**Monday 4/11**__: Everyone completes a draft of their work. Code review and, hopefully merge. Issues are generated for tweaks.

 - __**Monday 4/18**__: Feature revisions are submitted. Pull request to WebCat. Celebration!

 - __**Finals Week**__: Submit portfolio and presentation. I envision this including:
     - The software design document.
     - A slide show of what our contribution does.
     - A audio recording of us presenting on it.
     - Approximately 6 blog posts telling the story of our journey this semester.
