This blog is about my journey in becoming a software developer. Two years ago I took a course in Python at [Berea College][1] and it was love at Hello World. At first, the simple syntax was of course a big draw, but as I dug deeper I was impressed by the depth and breadth of the Standard Library, the impressive collection of packages on PyPI, and the community's mission for [one obvious way of solving a problem][2]. From that one class I knew that I wanted to do more. I've since expanded my work in Python, created web projects in Django, as well as learning RoR and JavaScript. I then took a Data Structures course where I learned important concepts like memory management, recursion, C++ etc.

This semester I am taking [Software Engineering][3] at Berea College where we will be joining a large open source project and (hopefully) making some meaningful contributions. My hope for this semester is to gain some experience contributing to software that actually gets used by others in the real world. It is of course one thing to write a final project in a class that solves a theoretical problem using an approach that makes sense to you (and maybe only you). Its another thing entirely to contribute to a code base in a way that is compatible with what others in the community deem useful and well written. Beyond the code, I'm also hoping to gain some more experience collaborating with experienced developers across space and time.

###Which project to choose?

We have several interesting projects to choose from.  Here are a few that stood out to me:

####OpenMRS

[OpenMRS][4] is an open source, free to use medical records system. Commercial medical records systems, designed for large hospitals can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more per year to use. If you are a free clinic in Indianapolis or Kenya, you likely do not have the budget to justify such an expense.  The concept of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) being used to help scrappy non profits achieve their mission is extremely compelling to me. OpenMRS however is written in Java, which I have no experience with. While Java is on my list of languages to learn, I'm afraid that diving into this project would involve too steep a learning curve, and make it less likely that I would get a pull request merged into the project.

**Summary:** Interesting project but I don't know Java (yet). Let's work somewhere where I can be more useful.

####CodeWorkout

[CodeWorkout][5] is a web based platform for people new to computer programming to practice simple problems. I wrote my first line of code only two years ago, and while I've come a long way since then, I remember how valuable the chance to tackle concrete problems was still learning the ropes. The project is built using Rails which I have experience with from a project I am working on at my current job at Berea College. While I am a fan of the Rails framework for its good organization and common sense defaults, I have a somewhat mixed opinion of Ruby. Like Python, the syntax is light and easy to read and provides users with a multitude of tools built right in.  There are however a few features of the language that I find a bit messy (e.g. implicit returns, optional parens, returning nil if trying to reference a non existent key in a hash) This is admittedly my own personal opinion, quite possibly fed by the fact that I was brought up on the language and philosophies of Python. There are plenty of [smart capable devs using Ruby][6]. While I have opinions about Ruby (or any language I encounter) **I have a much bigger opinion that for the good of the project, its necessary for new contributors to try and integrate themselves into the culture of the team.** If this means writing code in Ruby, so be it. **Its far better to contribute to a meaningful project than always have my choice of language.** CodeWorkout also appears to be very much a work still in progress (several features in the main page don't work). Also, this project appears to still be building its community (as of this post only 9 watches, 5 favorites and 3 forks on GitHub, mine included). All of this amounts to a project that likely needs help and functionality that still needs to be built out. My chances contributing work might be higher here.

**Summary**: Emerging project with need for help. While Ruby isn't my first choice, I'm experienced in it and can put aside my personal preferences for the sake of the team.

####OctoPrint

[OctoPrint][7] is free and open source web based software for 3-D printers. Its written in Python and JavaScript both of which I know, the former I love with a passion. 3-D printing is of course an exciting new technology which will only grow in its potential in the coming years. I currently don't know much about 3-D printing (which could be a stumbling block for me, I'm not sure) but its something that would certainly be important to know for the future. Python is the language I know best, so my chance of being able to contribute might be decent. On the other hand glancing at its GitHub page, this project seems to have a large community. Their need for help on "easy" tickets might not be as high.


**Summary**: Written in Python, but 3-D printing is new to me. Also, the contributing base seems high. Uncertain if I would be able to find something to contribute.:
