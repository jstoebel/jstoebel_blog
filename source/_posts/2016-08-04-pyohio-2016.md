This past weekend I attended my first developer conference: [PyOhio](http://www.pyohio.org/) in Columbus. As a relative newbie, it was somewhat scary to walk into a room of hundreds of *real* programers. This is a field where we always have more to learn and, unfortunately, I can't help but compare myself with others. Fortunately, the Python community lived up to its hype of being open and welcoming. Here are some of the experiences I had last weekend proving this point:

## Sessions for all levels

It was encouraging to see on the schedule several topics targeted specifically for novices. There was help on some tricky beginning concepts covered including regex and recursion as well as session called [Maybe I shouldn't be a programmer](http://pyohio.org/schedule/presentation/244/). This session was particularly helpful for me as an aspiring developer because I sometimes find myself in a frustrating place where I feel stuck. This session reminded us that everyone, including seasoned developers feel that way sometimes and provided some tips to help get yourself unstuck.

## Volunteering

The conference needs an army of volunteers for set up and to keep things running smoothly during the weekend. And, it turns out, its also a great way to meet new people. I volunteered each day that I was in Columbus. The day before the conference, I helped set up Raspberry Pis for the [Young Coders workshop](http://pyohio.org/young-coders/) and throughout the weekend I sat at the registration table. As an introvert, I have difficulty engaging in unstructured socializing, and find that having a task gives me just enough confidence to feel comfortable meeting new folks. Even though my job as a volunteer wasn't exactly earth shatteringly critical, its at least a small way to acknowledge that this conference comes together by lots of people pitching in.

## Artisanal Bots

One of the sessions everyone seemed to be talking about was by [Elizabeth Uselton](https://twitter.com/lizuselton) about making [Twitter bots](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18OKGRFEpEAmq37kOtDPM6aD5hSOdjYVwr6KFUH-D4Yw/edit#slide=id.p). Liz went through some of the concepts involved in creating a bot including OAuth, using APIs, scraping data from the web, and natural language processing using Python's nltk library. The talk was successful  because she covered the important details of making a bot without diving into the minuta of the code.

Liz's talk really spoke to me because instead of making me feeling lost in a sea of code, I left feeling like maybe I really am capable of pulling off a project of that size. Very inspiring!

## Mental Health

The Sunday keynote was by [Ed Finkler](https://twitter.com/funkatron) on [mental health in the developer community](http://pyohio.org/schedule/presentation/221/). Ed shared with us several sobering statistics including this one: that people with mental health issues miss more than 4 hours of work per week compared to people without who miss less than half that. This problem is compounded by the culture of silence that seems to be present in the developer community about mental health. Ed's solution? Help normalize mental health by talking with your co-workers about your relationship with mental health. You can also be certified in [mental health first aid](http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/cs/) a program that teaches people to recognize mental health issues in their community and encourage their co-workers to seek help.

## Sprints

Finally, the conference hosted sprints each evening of the conference as well as all day the Monday following. I got involved with an exciting new project called [Batavia](https://github.com/pybee/batavia/) which is the Python VM implemented in Javascript. There have been other projects to bring Python into the browser, including PyPy.js, which is a Javascript implementation of the JIT python run time. This involves a 15 Mb download, effectively making it impractical for users in many parts of the world. Batavia on the other hand is only a few Kb in size since it is only concerned with the execution of Python bytecode.

The project lead, [Russell Keith-Magee](https://twitter.com/freakboy3742) introduced us to the lowest hanging fruit which was to contribute to all of the combinations of python types and operators. After a little bit of work and mentorship, I managed to get [one working!](https://github.com/pybee/batavia/pull/211) Sweet! I even got this nifty coin for my contribution.

Wanting to keep going, I moved on to another one.  This one proved to be more difficult because it involved working with two types not yet implemented in Batavia. This led us down a much larger rabbit hole, but after Russell's patient mentorship and several hours on struggle I was able to complete this issue as well. He was even kind enough to give me a shoutout on Twitter!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A *huge* Batavia update from <a href="https://twitter.com/jstoebel">@jstoebel</a> - the bytes and bytearray types now work, fixing approx 500 test cases in one hit! Thanks, Jacob!</p>&mdash; PyBee (@PyBeeWare) <a href="https://twitter.com/PyBeeWare/status/760475184117710848">August 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

I would be lying if I said that being recognized on Twitter didn't mean anything to me. And why not? I'm still an aspiring developer, wondering if I will ever be able to cross that line where I can drop the word aspiring. This weekend, if nothing else, gave me just a little bit more confidence that I might be able to make that happen.

## Giving thanks

At the end of the conference, someone, amidst the wrap up house keeping, requested that if someone gave you something useful this weekend to reach out and thank them. First of all, the fact that this community values gratitude in the first place speak volumes. But beyond that I am grateful for everyone that I met at PyOhio that took the time to prepare a session, answer a question or simply have a conversation. They probably didn't realize it, but even small gestures of welcome and openness went a long way towards boosting my confidence that I might really be able to do this.
