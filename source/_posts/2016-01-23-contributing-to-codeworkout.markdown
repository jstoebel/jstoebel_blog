My chosen open source project for my [Software Engineering][1] class will be with [CodeWorkout][2], a platform for learning computer programming. From everything I can tell CodeWorkout is a scrappy up and coming open source project. They have a lot to get done still both in terms of user stories as well as documentation and outreach for new contributors like me. With that said here are the resources I found thus far:

Matt has been in correspondence with the maintainers of the project and they offered these ideas as potential places to contribute.

1. New Content: creating/reviewing new questions.
2. UI design: creating mockups in HTML for things like visualizing progression, user status, badging etc.
3. Feature implementation: They have ideas for new features including a Q&A section like Stackoverflow.

Exploring the projects Github page, I wasn't able to find a contributors.md, but I did find some other useful info for newbies:

- The [Readme.rdoc][3] provides some basic directions on setting up a development environment on your local machine.
- [Notes.txt][4] provides more information like best practices for using git, how to document work and formatting guidelines for Ruby. These are good FYIs for new contributors.
- [ERD.pdf][5] is an ERD of the project generated directly form the project's schema. This is a fantastic resource for people trying to get antiquated with the database and is so much more readable than a [schema][6] file, especially for newcomers like us.
- Finally the project's [Gemfile][7] is a great place to start when researching the third party gems used in this project.

While there is less in the way of formal documentation for new contributors, they seem open to on-boarding newbies via a more informal process of emailing the maintainers.
