<blockquote><p><b>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><em>-Sir Issac Newton</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can not think of a profession where Newton&#8217;s wisdom is more apt than software engineering. I will be forever indebted to the <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/hacker-history/index.html#id2763962" target="_blank">&#8220;Real Programmers&#8221;</a> (problematic phrase I know) who programmed the ENIAC, developed UNIX and Linux and C and put human beings on a moon with the computational firepower a measly fraction of what I have in my pocket. And, its worth noting that they didn&#8217;t let all of these marvelous discoveries become completely monetized and closed source. If Lovelace is standing on the first floor of the immense skyscraper that is computer science, each floor a layer of abstraction stacked one on top of the next, I am sitting on floor ten-thousand typing away into a C python interpreter, inside of a virtualenv, inside of a Docker container inside of a VPS. Shoulders of giants? I stand on the shoulder of a colossus.</p>
<p>I could perhaps devote a lifetime and hope to gain a modest understanding of the layout of all of the floors that sit below me. But I won&#8217;t. Not with all of the cool stuff that&#8217;s getting stacked on top of me. This is incredibly exciting but at the same time humbling and perhaps a little scary because it reminds me of the fact that <strong>no matter how hard I work there will always be big chunks of my work that I won&#8217;t understand, that I will always feel behind and that there will always be people who know more than me. </strong><strong>The cafeteria of the CS skyscraper serves Humble Pie 24-7.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps one of my biggest struggles is being ok with public ignorance. There is perhaps some privilege embedded in this discomfort, I realize, given that some folks are constantly being evaluated on what they know, and that knowledge forms the basis for how others evaluate, not just that person, but that person&#8217;s group. But none the less it isn&#8217;t a good feeling when everyone knows you don&#8217;t know something. And in software engineering, this happens <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<p>So what can I do? Keep climbing? Yes. Become more antiquated with the floors below me? Of course. Perspective is important. There are plenty of topics in computer science that, while interesting, simply aren&#8217;t my cup of tea. Similarly, there are items that I am very excited about. Both of these truths can help me &#8220;prune&#8221; my options a bit. Most importantly though, its important for me to use my feeling of &#8220;not knowing enough&#8221; as a positive motivating force. I could choose to see the gap between what I know and what I &#8220;need to know&#8221; as nothing but negative and let this become a source of incredible frustration for me. This frustration could root itself in my work and quite possibly lead to burn out in a few years. Or, on the other hand, I could think of it more as a check list and say &#8220;here are the awesome things I know already, and <em>here</em> are the even awesomer things I <em>get </em>to learn just as soon as I admit I don&#8217;t know them&#8221;. Put a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on my slice of humble pie. I&#8217;m too hungry to hide behind pride.</p>
