Now that I've had the chance to dig into the CodeWorkout codebase a bit more, I have some more specific ideas on how I might be able to contribute:

 - **Instructor's Dashboard:** CodeWorkout has a fairly large ERD with numerous resources and an elaborate set of relationships between them. I would be interested in building an instructors' dashboard which acts as a portal for all actions instructors have permission to perform on the site. Including...
     - Adding and editing students.
     - Adding and editing exercises and workouts either via a YAML file or a web form.
     - Various other instructor user stories spelled out in the current code could be implemented and linked to this dashboard.

 - **Student's Dashboard:** Similarly I would like to help build out the student's dashboard. Some potential features here could include:

    - I would like to help build out the ability of students not associated with any VT class to search and complete workouts and participate in the community.
     - Once student's have earned a certain number of points, they would be able to submit their own exercises that can be reviewed by the community. This might work similarly to [codewars.com][1]
    - I would also be interested in helping build or integrate a Q&A forum similar to StackOverflow.
    - Finally it might be neat if student work can be saved into a portfolio that they can reference for future use or share with prospective employers. 


Obviously all of these ideas are not possible in one semester, but all of them sound compiling to me. With that said, the most important thing to me is that I contribute something that would be useful to the project. So if none of the ideas listed here are interesting to the CodeWorkout community I would love to know what would be a better alternative.
