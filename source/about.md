I am a software developer living in Berea, KY. I spend my days writing web applications (Ruby, Python, JavaScript), working with data, and leveling up as a software engineer. I work and study at Berea College. This is my blog.

I specialize in:

 - Ruby/Rails
 - Python/Django  
 - Javascript / React
 <!--  coming soon flask -->
 <!-- coming soon, Node.js -->


#My projects

## Python: where it all started

I started learning programing on Python in 2013 when I took a course at Berea College (where I also am currently employed) and it was love from `print("Hello, world!")`. I immediately turned my new found powers on my clerical job where I used Python to automate many of my monotonous tasks. Taking advantage of the rich standard library, augmented by PyPi allowed me simple yet powerful tools to do file I/0,
send emails, scrape data from the web, and manage Excel and Access files. My work suddenly became a _lot_ more accurate and probably saved me from carpal tunnel. I was hooked.


## My first full scale web app: Ruby on Rails

While my new found skills were helpful in automating my work, it was clear that the department needed to graduate from desperate spreadsheets and Access databases and bring everything under a single web application. Finding all of the commercially available products not
specific enough to suit our program's needs, I set out to create a product perfectly
tailored to address the programs goals. I researched the options and ultimately decided on Ruby on Rails. Several frameworks like Django, Flask and Node had their appeal (and I could have been perfectly happy with them too), but I ultimately landed on Rails for its strong documentation and community support. Rails is highly opinionated about how it should be designed (convention or customization). While experienced developers might find this an impediment, as a beginner, I found it an asset to be given a clear path on how to structure things. The project is now more than a year old and has
provided me with a tremendous learning experience in building and maintaining software to address a real world problem space.


## Fullstack Javascript

In my spare time, I hack on projects at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/jstoebel). Freecodecamp's curriculum is fullstack Javascript (jQuery, React, D3, Node, MongoDB). Currently, I am focusing on leveling up on React and D3. Soon I will dive into Node. All of my sample work from FCC can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/jstoebel).
